●I signed up for GitHub by providing my username, email, and password, then verified my email to activate my account. After logging in with my credentials, I created a markdown file by selecting "Add file" > "Create new file," naming it, and saving it using "Commit new file." Additionally, I created a public repository and explored its features to familiarize myself with GitHub's functionality.
